- This is an ipython notebook for analysts and learners who are eager to interact with and build intelligence from the social media service **Twitter**.
- To use this resource, you need to have a twitter API account and have your credentials ready to go
- There are two required modules to work with **Tweepy** and **Twython**

## Aim
- This module will help you recreate *Twitter Exchanges*: conversations on Twitter.

## Modus
- This scripts finds a tweet by it's id, check's if it is a reply and walks back the conversation up to the original tweet.
- For best result you will want to identify the very last exchange in the mix

## Helper
- As there is still some work to do to get the id of the tweet of interest, I have also include a function *profile_Scrapper* to help retrieve all tweets of a handle.

## Suggested Updates/Features
- I am working on getting all replies to a single tweet which service is not included in Twitter's API but if there any other things you would love to do on twitter around conversations, feel free to drop me a line.
